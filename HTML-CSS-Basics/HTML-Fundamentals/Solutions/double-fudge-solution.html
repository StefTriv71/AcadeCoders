  <p>Here is the recipe</p>

  <h4>Incredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup salted butter (melted and cooled - directions in step one)</li>
    <li>1½ cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons strong coffee</li>
    <li>2⅔ cup all purpose flour (more if it's too sticky)</li>
    <li>½ cup cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Prepping the Butter:</strong>Melt ½ cup butter in the microwave for 30-45 seconds or until completely melted. Transfer to the refrigerator or freezer and cool until solid, about 30 minutes. Leave the other ½ cup butter out on the counter to bring it to room temperature. If the butter is rock solid (usually from the freezer) I stick it back in the microwave for 10 seconds to get it workable again. See notes for more info.</li>
    <li><strong>Dough Part One:</strong>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. With an electric mixer (I usually just use a hand-held one), cream the melted/solid butter, room temperature butter, sugar, and vanilla until creamy and fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until just incorporated.</li>
    <li><strong>Dough Part Two</strong>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the creamy butter mixture and mix until incorporated, adding the coffee gradually as you go. The dough should be thick and sticky, but dry enough to touch with your hands without making a huge mess. If it's still too sticky, add more flour. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
    <li><strong>Baking</strong>Roll the dough into even balls (I got about 20 out of the whole batch) and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 8 minutes and transfer to a cooling rack right away. They will be underdone and super puffy, which makes them perfectly soft, thick, and fudgy when cooled.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>The butter melting and cooling is something I always do for my cookies (see <a href="http://pinchofyum.com/tips-for-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies" target="_blank">Tips for Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies</a>) and I would strongly recommend that you take the extra time to do that part, even though, I know, it's annoying, you just want the cookies right now. I get it. But if you don't melt and cool the butter as directed, I can't guarantee that the cookies will turn out correctly because it affects the amount of flour needed and ultimately the thickness and fudginess of the cookie.</p>
